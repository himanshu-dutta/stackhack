# StackHack

`TODO` Add proper details

### Achievable:

-   Question-Answering: Our system should be able to generate answers to the asked questions intelligently.
-   Answer Morphing: When a new question is asked, if there exists a similar question (asked before) such that the answers to the older question(s) could be morphed (rephrased, improved upon, partially used) to answer the new question, the system should use the information to generate new answers.
-   Optimized Database Search: Given a new question, find the questions best matching to it and try to provide the top answers, as suggestions for the answer to the new question.

### Doables:

-   Question-Answering
-   Answer-Morphing
-   Optimized Database Search
-   Data Gathering and Cleaning: Look for dataset, if not exists, contribute new dataset.
-   Backend Development
-   Frontend Design and Development
-   `Probing studies`
